Build deps:
* cmake
** optional: ccmake or qcmake
* make
* c-compiler
* libc headers
* optional: git

For debian derived distributions, you can issue
this command to get the deps:
* sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake
** cmake guis: cmake-curses-gui and cmake-qt-gui

Getting the sources:
* cd
* either 
** "git clone https://github.com/Ralith/libreprap.git"
** download an archive from https://github.com/Ralith/libreprap/archives/master and "tar -xf Ralith-libreprap*"

Building and installing:
* cmake .
** or "ccmake ." or "qcmake ." for changing the install prefix or adding the debug flag
* make && sudo make install

By default, the files are installed under /usr/local/, but some distros don't
include it into the search path for dynamic libs (running a binary that links
against libreprap might reports something like "Can't find libreprap.so" or so).
There are two ways to fix that:
* Change the install prefix to /usr/ instead of /usr/local, which is not recommended
* Add /usr/local/bin to ld.conf by creating a file /etc/ld.so.conf.d/local.conf which includes only the line "/usr/local/lib"
** run "sudo ldconfig" afterwards
