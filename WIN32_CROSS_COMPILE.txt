Ubuntu Natty instructions.

Make sure wine, mingw32 and nsis packages are installed w/ apt.

You need the right version of mingw32 (mingw32, not gcc-mingw32 in Ubuntu natty is built
with --disable-shared, which breaks C++ exception handling. See
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=625778). I haven't tried OpenSuse's mingw32
to see if it has the same problem.
As of 10 Mar 2012, Debian's mingw32 package doesn't have the required shared version of
libgcc_s, and needs rebuilding with a patch to provide it. Basically, check that the
version of mingw32 you have installs a libgcc_s.a and provides libgcc_sjlj_1.dll.

Create a build dir and

export BUILDDIR=`pwd`/build/

Get gtkmm win32 binaries (http://live.gnome.org/gtkmm/MSWindows)
Gtk gtkglext win32 http://www.bonifazi.eu/appunti/gtkglext-win32-1.2.0.exe
Install both into build dir.

# Install GLUT for win32
# http://www.opengl.org/wiki/MinGW
# Get zip file, unpack. mkdir 

# Build/install mingw32 version of libtool. FIXME: Not sure if libtool is needed.
apt-get source libtool
./configure --host=i586-mingw32msvc --prefix="$BUILDDIR" --enable-static --disable-shared
make && make install

# Build
cd repsnapper

PKG_CONFIG=$BUILDDIR/bin/pkg-config.exe CPPFLAGS=-I$BUILDDIR/include PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$BUILDDIR/lib/pkgconfig ./configure --host=i586-mingw32msvc --prefix="$BUILDDIR" --enable-doxygen=no
make && make install

TODO: Wrap it all up into installer with NSIS script.
