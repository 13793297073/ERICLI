==Installing Repsnapper==
--Binaries--
Windows

   1. download RepSnapper.exe here: http://svn.kulitorum.com/RepSnapper/MSVC/Release/
   2. run RepSnapper using RepSnapper.exe (you will need OpenGL) 

OSX
David Buzz made a binary distribution, you can get it here: https://sites.google.com/site/davidbuzz/repsnapper-for-osx-binaries (RepSnapper-01-09-2010.dmg at the bottom of the page)
RepSnapper Installation

Linux
   (to be updated)

--Building From Source--

Although RepSnapper is not generally tested outside of window/linux/mac you may be able to get it running on other OS's. To do so you will need the following:

    * gcc and stuff
    * OpenGL
    * SVN
    * libfltk1.1
    * libfltk1.1-dev
    * libglut3
    * libglut3-dev
    * libboost1.37 and -dev (or higher version) 

Linux
Debian/Ubuntu

To install the dependencies listed above on Ubunutu or any debian-based linux run the following from prompt:

sudo apt-get install build-essential fluid libgtk2.0-dev libfltk1.1 libfltk1.1-dev libglut3 libglut3-dev libboost1.38-dev

For my configuration (Jolicloud, an Ubuntu derivative):

sudo apt-get install build-essential fluid libgtk2.0-dev libfltk1.1 libfltk1.1-dev libglut3 libglut3-dev libboost1.37-dev libboost-thread1.37-dev libboost-system1.37-dev

For Ubuntu 10.04 use:

sudo apt-get install build-essential fluid libgtk2.0-dev libfltk1.1 libfltk1.1-dev libglut3 libglut3-dev libboost1.40-dev libboost-thread-dev libboost-system-dev

If you wan't to minimize dependencies, these are needed in addition to the ones above, but normally pulled in by being recommended by other packages:

libboost-regex-dev libboost-filesystem-dev

Fedora 14:

cd Src
make clean
make

(If you get a file/directory does not exist error (e.g. if using ubuntu 10.04) try this:)

cd RepSnapper/Libraries/xml/
make
cd ../../Src/
make

OS-X
You can download the RepSnapper source using svn here by running:

git clone git://github.com/timschmidt/repsnapper.git

Eclipse Project

As a new feature RepSnapper now comes with an Eclipse Galileo(3.5) project.

Grab a svn client like kdesvn and start the download.

Grab the Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers from the download page http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/

Throw in an additional SVN plugin - Help | Install New Software...

    * Subclipse - http://subclipse.tigris.org/update_1.6.x
          o Just take them all 

Eclipse is Java and that means a svn wrapper. So shut down Eclipse and get it.

sudo  apt-get install libsvn-java

Ubuntu users may wish to open the System|Administration|Synaptic Package Manager and do a quick search for libsvn instead as that will ensure Eclipse can find it.

When the donwload is complete enter the Eclipse folder in the repository and read the Readme.txt for last minute instructions.

At some point you'll need to reboot, so if you haven't done it before do it now.

Notice that while you downloaded the code with kdesvn you can now use svn directly from eclipse.

The build all works and so does the run and debug functionality, enjoy.
