--- the plan ---

* do settings work ...
	* auto-connect settings to the UI
	* re-factor the core to remove ProcessController ... [!]

	+ build a biig table of name / glade-name / type mappings
	+ another biig table of spin-button / range details etc.
	+ abandon 'Apron' stuff ...
	float Examine;
	int m_ShrinkQuality;


* win32 osc build fun ...
* re-factor more ...

--- misc stuff ---

* Connection foo
	+ connect stuff
	* rename processcontroller.h to 'settings' or 'config' globally ... ?
		+ add a 'changed' signal ...
		* bin CopySettingsToGUI

	+ get settings imported
	+ move ModelViewController DetectComPorts to RepRapSerial ...
	  ditto ValidateComPort

* connection button
	+ should require confirmation before going off-line
	  during a print ... [ and/or 'pause printing' ]

* signal emissions should hold toolkit lock !?
	+ make toolkit lock recursive

* kill all reprapserial uses of 'mvc'
	+ incoming: temperature (2x) feedback
		+ temp_changed signals ...
	+ communication & error logs (and auto-scrolling)
		+ direct GtkTextBuffer access...
	+ access to 'DownstreamMultiplierSlider' / ExtrusionMultiplier
		+ [ better via ProcessController surely !? ]

* serial connection
	* add a test serial connection ...
	* add better error reporting 
	* add signals to sync. with interactive display
	  eg. temp / bed on etc.

* RFO re-work
	+ class name fixing: RFO_File etc.
	+ encapsulate the selection concept in a clean abstract object
	+ re-work RFO storage to use pointers not vectors with instances

* add click-to-select in the 3D view

* re-factor MVC
	+ 
	* rename view.cpp etc. to render.cpp
		* include SpinRows in view.cpp ...
	* split modelviewcontroller.cpp to view.cpp etc.
		* split out / create an 'RFOView' widget to (sanely) manipulate that treeview ...

* bug fixing:
	+ arcball / rotation resetting ...
	+ re-instate a non-gui mode ...
