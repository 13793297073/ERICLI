--- the plan ---

* most odd - we do a double re-send:

21535 1309467603.884195 read(8, "\nr", 253) = 2
21535 1309467603.884965 read(8, "s ", 255) = 2
21535 1309467603.885626 write(8, "N10 G1 X84.15 E73.8 F4000*82\n", 29) = 29
21535 1309467603.886355 read(8, "9 ", 253) = 2
21535 1309467603.886966 read(8, "Se", 251) = 2
... [ same error ] ...
21535 1309467603.932624 read(8, ": N9", 165) = 4
21535 1309467603.934741 read(8, "*124", 161) = 4
21535 1309467603.936597 read(8, "\r\n", 157) = 2
21535 1309467603.937062 write(8, "N9 G1 X11.85 E1.5 F4000*87\n", 27) = 27
21535 1309467603.937740 read(8, "rs", 155) = 2
21535 1309467603.938137 write(8, "N9 G1 X11.85 E1.5 F4000*87\n", 27) = 27
21535 1309467603.938807 read(8, " 9", 254) = 2
21535 1309467603.940142 read(8, " S", 252) = 2
21535 1309467603.942942 read(8, "erial ", 250) = 6

      + why !? is this the existing 'fmtblock'd output ?
        is it a sequencing issue ? - should the re-send
	de-queue a currently sending node ? if (node == sending_node)

      + add 'access' syscalls to the debug method to queue strace output ...


* libreprap:
	+ don't write anything (particularly a re-send) while
	  a partial read is underway [?]
	+ add a 'comms_debug' boolean ...

* sort out stdafx.h includes - check whether it is
  needed, and where ...

* Serial
	+ error dialogs - "failed to connect ?"
	+ /dev/ttyUSB0 - EACCES
		+ group / permissions problem.
		+ you need to tweak permissions, or add yourself
		  to XYZ group, and re-login ...

* Finish the 'Display' settings page
* add Hardware Settings profiles:
	+ "Mendel", "XYZ", "etc." ? :-)

* do settings work ...
	* auto-connect settings to the UI
	* finish the settings we cannot do manually ...
		+ custom button foo ...
	+ another biig table of spin-button / range details etc.

* win32 osc build fun ...

--- older stuff ---

* connection button
	+ should require confirmation before going off-line
	  during a print ... [ and/or 'pause printing' ]

* serial connection
	* add a test serial connection ...

* RFO re-work
	+ class name fixing: RFO_File etc.
	+ encapsulate the selection concept in a clean abstract object
	+ re-work RFO storage to use pointers not vectors with instances

* add click-to-select in the 3D view

* bug fixing:
	+ arcball / rotation resetting ...
	+ re-instate a non-gui mode ...

* add log scrolling:
	+ gtk_text_view_scroll_to_iter [etc.]
	+ when the adjustments change etc.
