 * fatal. Of course, we get that lock when we enter from the mainloop
 * so - check if we are already entering from that, and do not acquire
 * the lock. Sadly no glibmm binding of this yet.
 *
 * If force is true we take the lock even if we own the mainloop, this
 * is useful for eg. for idle handlers.
